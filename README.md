# All-Prompt-Engineering-Techniques
As part of my continuous learning in the field of AI and large language models, I have been exploring prompt engineering to better understand how to design effective interactions with generative models. This journey has not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my ability to apply creative problem-solving techniques across different use cases. A significant part of this learning has come from NirDiamantâ€™s GitHub, where his prompt engineering tutorials provided practical, hands-on insights into structuring and refining prompts for maximum impact.
