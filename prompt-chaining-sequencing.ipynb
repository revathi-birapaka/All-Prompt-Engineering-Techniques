    "### Prompt Chaining and Sequencing Tutorial\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial explores the concepts of prompt chaining and sequencing in the context of working with large language models. We'll use OpenAI's GPT models and the LangChain library to demonstrate how to connect multiple prompts and build logical flows for more complex AI-driven tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "As AI applications become more sophisticated, there's often a need to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Prompt chaining and sequencing allow us to guide language models through a series of interrelated prompts, enabling more structured and controlled outputs. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that require multiple stages of processing or decision-making."
