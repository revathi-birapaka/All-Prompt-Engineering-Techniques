    "### Zero-Shot Prompting Tutorial\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to zero-shot prompting, a powerful technique in prompt engineering that allows language models to perform tasks without specific examples or prior training. We'll explore how to design effective zero-shot prompts and implement strategies using OpenAI's GPT models and the LangChain library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting is crucial in modern AI applications as it enables language models to generalize to new tasks without the need for task-specific training data or fine-tuning. This capability significantly enhances the flexibility and applicability of AI systems, allowing them to adapt to a wide range of scenarios and user needs with minimal setup."
