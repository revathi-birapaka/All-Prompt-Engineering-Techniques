    "### Prompt Length and Complexity Management\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This tutorial explores techniques for managing prompt length and complexity when working with large language models (LLMs). We'll focus on two key aspects: balancing detail and conciseness in prompts, and strategies for handling long contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "Effective prompt engineering often requires finding the right balance between providing enough context for the model to understand the task and keeping prompts concise for efficiency.
